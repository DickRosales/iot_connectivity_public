# Insights Into Connecting Industrial IoT Assets
## A publication by the Open Manufacturing Platform


## 1 Manufacturing at an Inflection Point

As the 4th industrial revolution unfolds, opportunities and threats present themselves to the entire manufacturing sector. Companies that embrace the change through experimentation and evolution will thrive while stagnant companies will struggle. Digitization is at the center of the revolution, and connectivity is paramount to digitizing all aspects of the manufacturing value chain.

In manufacturing, multiple challenges complicate the connection of sensors, actuators, and machines to a central data center. Lack of common standards and proprietary interfaces leads each engineer to solve similar problems, introducing inefficiencies and forcing the ascension of the same learning curve over and over. The long renewal cycles of shop floor equipment, software, and processes present gaps in modern technologies and a general avoidance of making significant institutional changes.

Each connectivity challenge will have a range of diverse constituents. Operational technology (OT) professionals are responsible for the commissioning, operation, and maintenance of shop floor equipment while information technology (IT) personnel look after overall data processing, the hardware and software infrastructure, and enterprise-wide IT strategy. General managers and logistics teams are typically aligned at a corporate level, coordinating strategy across a network of plants. Each of these functions will have roles spanning from operational hands-on to strategic and managerial. The unique demands of each part will require connectivity solutions to be forward-thinking and value-accretive while offering practical solutions implemented with minimal incremental investment. The overall goal is to transform data into information, information that can be leveraged by the stakeholders to create business value. Examples include: Optimizing existing business processes (e.g., Improving OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)), building new business models, business-to-business data exchanges, and strategic partnering opportunities.

Raw data needs to be collected, aggregated across multiple data sources, consolidated, and analyzed to create information. Typically, data sources include shop floor machines, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition-Systems (SCADA), Manufacturing Execution System (MES), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Distributed Control System (DCS) systems, as well as external supplier data. Historically these systems have been proprietary; containing locked down data formats and limited interoperability. Going forward, Industry 4.0 will necessitate the breaking down of these silos, and openness and interoperability will be essential to intelligent systems that persist into the future.

The Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP) was founded to harness the power of collaboration and openness, combining industry-leading companies and knowledge to solving challenges shared across the industry. Collectively innovating and working together creates practical solutions to real-world problems. Connectivity is the first working group because it is a cornerstone of unlocking additional scenarios, and this paper is the initial publication laying out an approach to solving connectivity challenges while providing a roadmap for future work.
