## 6	Conclusion
From simple performance reporting to AI-optimized process control, IIoT connectivity is an essential cornerstone to digitalizing any industrial solution. For this, open standards and open-source implementations are important prerequisites.

The OMP establishes collaboration and open-source thoughts in the manufacturing domain, resulting in a robust approach that can scale easily throughout the technology stack, across manufacturing sites, and between different members within the value chain.

A complete technology solution includes connectivity as well as many other dimensions and technological considerations. To address this, the OMP has started different working groups covering various domains:

* Architectural guidance will be provided for standard manufacturing uses case through the Manufacturing Reference Architecture working group.
* Contextualization is imperative for transforming data into insight, and it is the main topic in the Semantic Data Structuring working group.

Subsequent publications by the IoT Connectivity Working Group will build upon this publication and dive more deeply into specific use cases and different layers of the technology stack. Topics such as device provisioning, certificate management, and store-and-forward mechanism for offline situations will be explored in-depth in future publications. The joint collaboration of different manufacturing companies will accelerate the development of production-ready software products and support the manufacturing community in implementing connectivity use cases that are reliable, innovative and secure.
